Soidified project idea, settled on the idea of a sensor cluster wearable that will monitor health and surrounding hazards, mainly used for construction
or other unseen dangers in which the personnel would not usually be able to detect otherwise. Could be expanded as a way of monitoring the health and environment of 
personnel in areas that are hard to reach.
Decided on some potential models of sensors and microprocessors, protocol to be used will be I2C. First prototype will be done through protoboard.
Also began to look up sources on the potential marketability of similar wearables or if there are any pre-existing products.
